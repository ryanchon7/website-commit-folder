              <h2>Who am I?</h2>
              <p>
                I was born in Korea and grew up moving between different parts
                of the world — from the busy streets of Hong Kong to the open
                spaces of America and the calm rhythm of Japan. Those
                experiences shaped who I am today, giving me a mix of cultures,
                perspectives, and languages that help me adapt easily and
                connect with people from many backgrounds. Now, at 20 years old,
                I see myself as someone who enjoys exploring new ideas, sounds,
                and flavors, constantly learning from every place I’ve lived.

              <h2>My Favorite Music Artists</h2>
              <p>
                One of my biggest passions is music. I’ve always been drawn to
                the emotion andl rhythm of rap and hip-hop — the way it tells
                real stories with energy and creativity. I listen to artists
                like Drake, Young Thug, Lil Tecca, Lil Uzi Vert, and JSSR, who
                all inspire me in different ways. Music gives me focus when I
                work and freedom when I need to relax; it’s something that
                connects my different experiences no matter where I am.

              <h2>My Favorite Sports</h2>
              <p>
                Sports have also been a big part of my life. I love the strategy
                of baseball, the fast pace of basketball, the intensity of
                football, and the thrill of skiing down a mountain. Sports have
                taught me discipline, teamwork, and persistence — lessons that
                apply far beyond the field. Whether it’s competing or just
                watching a good game, I find it’s one of the best ways to
                challenge myself and stay grounded.

              <h2>My Favorite Foods</h2>
              <p>
                And then there’s food — one of the most joyful ways I connect
                with culture. My favorite cuisines are Korean, Japanese,
                Mexican, and French, each representing a different part of my
                journey. I love the bold flavors of Korean dishes, the balance
                in Japanese food, the spice of Mexican meals, and the elegance
                of French cuisine. For me, food is not just about eating — it’s
                about memories, creativity, and the feeling of home wherever I
                go.
